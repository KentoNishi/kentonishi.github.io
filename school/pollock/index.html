      <h2>How are counterfeits made?</h2>
      <p>
      In China, obtaining parts for a phone is the equivalent of a trip to the local supermarket. To prove this, the Wall Street Journal went out to Shenzhen, China, to create their own phone. Their short documentary video explains how cheap and easy it is to make a smartphone in China, out of custom parts. “Making a custom smartphone is not that difficult,” they say, as they watch their 70 dollar “WSJ One” finish the 8 minute assembly process (Wall Street Journal).  Companies like GooPhone, which makes counterfeit products, are using the Chinese dominance in the electronics industry to get parts for extremely low prices. By using these parts, devices can be made at incredibly low costs like the WSJ One, and be sold for mind-blowing retail prices.

      <h2>Why do companies make counterfeits?</h2>
      <p>
      According to an email interview with Mrs. Robin Feldman, a law professor at the University of Hastings, counterfeit companies are driven forward by the lack of protection and law enforcement over counterfeit production. She explains that a company will “copy intellectual property when it is not well protected, either because the rules or the enforcement is weak”. Many companies make great profits making counterfeits, as according to the OECD, trading of fake goods are worth half a trillion dollars a year. Furthermore, she explains that counterfeits will never disappear, because “people are often willing to buy cheaper products, even if those products are knock-offs”. Companies are driven to produce counterfeits by the extremely profitable products, and the lack of law enforcement against them.
