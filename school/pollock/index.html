      In China, obtaining parts for a phone is the equivalent of a trip to the local supermarket. To prove this, the Wall Street Journal went out to Shenzhen, China, to create their own phone. Their short documentary video explains how cheap and easy it is to make a smartphone in China, out of custom parts. “Making a custom smartphone is not that difficult,” they say, as they watch their 70 dollar “WSJ One” finish the 8 minute assembly process (Wall Street Journal).  Companies like GooPhone, which makes counterfeit products, are using the Chinese dominance in the electronics industry to get parts for extremely low prices. By using these parts, devices can be made at incredibly low costs like the WSJ One, and be sold for mind-blowing retail prices.

      <h2>Why do companies make counterfeits?</h2>

      According to an email interview with Mrs. Robin Feldman, a law professor at the University of Hastings, counterfeit companies are driven forward by the lack of protection and law enforcement over counterfeit production. She explains that a company will “copy intellectual property when it is not well protected, either because the rules or the enforcement is weak”. Many companies make great profits making counterfeits, as according to the OECD, trading of fake goods are worth half a trillion dollars a year. Furthermore, she explains that counterfeits will never disappear, because “people are often willing to buy cheaper products, even if those products are knock-offs”. Companies are driven to produce counterfeits by the extremely profitable products, and the lack of law enforcement against them.

      <h2>How do companies like this exist?</h2>

      <p>Illegal companies like GooPhone are, in theory, not be allowed to exist. Legally, they can be shut down by any time, if large manufactures take action. This doesn’t happen often though, as “in general, companies may choose not to enforce their rights if the costs would outweigh the benefits,” according to Mrs. Feldman. Costs involved in court cases between nations can be more than the actual resulting profits for the company, so many large companies just decide to stay idle. So, it’s up to us consumers to stop counterfeits. When I asked Mrs. Feldman how consumers can help, she answered in three words, “Buy legitimate goods”. To stop the source of income and encouragement for illegal counterfeit activity, all we have to do to help companies and industries is to buy real goods, and not fakes. Don’t order fake Supremes and Yeezys, just to be “cool” in school. Don’t buy a fake phone just for the glory of the logo on the back. If consumers can take down the potential for counterfeit businesses to a minimum, they won’t be as driven to produce them either. Together, us consumers can drive the counterfeit industry to a minimum, and improve the future of products.
